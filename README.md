## Assignment 7

In this project, we designed a store so that when you enter the window, you will see a menu that contains 8 parts, which receives a number between 1 and 8 from the user and shows the selected option in the menu based on the input. We defined a function for each section inside the menu
In this store, the user enters the code of the items he wants, if there is one, it is placed in the shopping cart and deducted from the stock, and when leaving, an invoice is printed, in which the price of each item and the total price are written.
